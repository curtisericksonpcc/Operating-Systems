Device management- Operating systems manages all devices that are plugged in via their respective drivers. It keeps 
track of all devices, and assigns a program to each device with the Input/output controller. Also, the OS
determines how long devices have access and which devices can be deallocated when you're done using them.

Processor Management: The OS controls the order that processes interface with the processor and how long it has
to perform these tasks. This is called "process scheduling," and keeps tabs on the processes status and allocates/deallocates
the CPU to perform the given task. All of this uses a program called a "traffic controller" to manage the allocations/deallocations.

Memory Management: The OS manages main/primary memory by keeping tabs on which bytes of memory are utilized by which programs. Every bit
of the main memory is made up of bytes and words, with each having their own unique address. Like the previous functions, memory is allocated
and deallocated depending on need and dictates how long processes have access to memory.
